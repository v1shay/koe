/// The view rendered by the dictation overlay pill during the `.formatting`
/// beat — the window between STT completion and the success checkmark while
/// the AI formatter is polishing the transcript.
///
/// Renders a **spinning Seed of Life** whose six coral petal circles grow
/// in place from tiny vertex dots into full petals. Rotation is continuous
/// from first paint through dismissal — there is no settle phase, no
/// angular snap, and no restart after the bloom completes. The composition
/// orbits at a meditative ~10s/rev for the entire formatter window.
///
/// ## Why it reads as a natural morph from the `.processing` Merkaba
///
/// Two geometric properties carry the transition:
///
/// 1. **6-fold symmetry.** The Merkaba in `SpinnerRingView` carries six
///    vertex lights (two triangles × three vertices) arranged at 60°
///    around the center. This view carries six coral petals, also at
///    60° around the center. The eye sees "six things → six things"
///    during the cross-fade, even though the individual elements morph.
///
/// 2. **Matching bounding ring.** Each petal's outer edge reaches a
///    radius of `2 × ringOffset` = `size × 0.44` from the center, which
///    is visually close to `SpinnerRingView`'s outer-vertex radius of
///    `size × 0.423`. So the coral bloom fills approximately the same
///    circle the Merkaba's vertex lights were tracing, and the
///    transition reads as a geometry re-composition rather than a
///    resize or relocation.
///
/// The petal *centers* sit at `size × 0.22` — half the Merkaba vertex
/// radius — so each petal grows *inward* from the outer bounding ring
/// toward its center. If you retune `ringOffset`, re-check that the
/// resulting `2 × ringOffset` stays close to `SpinnerRingView.radius`
/// so the cross-fade continues to feel continuous.
///
/// ## Phases (all concurrent with the continuous rotation)
/// - **Bud**   (0 → 0.15s): six coral dots ignite at the vertex ring.
/// - **Bloom** (0.15 → 1.00s): each dot expands in place into a full
///   Seed of Life petal. Breath and nexus heartbeat come in gently.
/// - **Hold**  (1.00s → ∞): the full flower rotates + breathes until
///   the formatter completes and the success checkmark takes over.
///
/// ## Accessibility
/// Honors `Reduce Motion` by presenting the fully-bloomed peak state
/// statically — the user still sees the coral flower, just no spin. The
/// view is exposed to VoiceOver as "Refining transcript."
